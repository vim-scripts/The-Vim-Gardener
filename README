  'For code surgeons and web gardeners everywhere'

A nice earthy  color scheme which is easy on  the eyes. It
has  as it's  base a  dark background  monocrhomatic khaki
scheme with dabs of color thrown  in here and there on the
keywords. It's gives you the feeling of looking at the sun through 
the afternoon spring leaves, but all at night time :)

Plus  lots of  extra config  options so  you can
tweak  it to  your liking  and or  make it  more like  the
original Guardian scheme. All the defaults are what I like
but if you want to change stuff just set the right var and
it will change pretty much  immediately, you might have to
move out of and back into your buffer for it to refresh.

  256 Color XTerm Compatibility
  Richer Syntax
  Black Background
